Common_Armyworm,Wheat,"Establishment to early plant senescence  (L5, L6)",,"Risk potential does not consider densities of pests, only the plant and pest life-stages associated with moderate or high damage potential if sufficient densities are reached. This tool aims to prioritise monitorring efforts."
